If you're on Ubuntu/Trisquel or Debian, install a similar setup to mine by running the following, don't worry, I'll make a script eventually.

`sudo apt -y install vim vim-syntastic vim-pathogen; mkdir ~/.vim; mkdir ~/.vim/bundle; cd ~/.vim/bundle; git clone "https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise`




other than this .vimrc, I have a .bashrc, which I will be uploading, and a .gitconfig, which tells my system to use gpg2 rather than gpg for signing

I only use one pathogen installed plugin not available in binary packages from debian or ubuntu and that's tpope/vim-endwise
